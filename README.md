# Changes I have done

1. Use ESLinting for improve the code qulity.
2. Use prettier to format the code.
3. Used TanStack React Query for state managements.
4. Used the App.css stylings.
5. Used axios for HTTP requests.

# More improvements
1. If we can use tailwind css it would be easy to do stylings instead of writing raw CSS.
2. If we use use pre-built components libraries like NextUI, MUI, Shadcn, we can quickly build components.
